A few tips for testing
0. pip install -r requirements.txt
1. Delete the csv to test the code on how it fetches date as far as available
2. To test the incremental update of data:
   The code uses last modified date of the csv to find out how much more data needs to be fetched 
    touch -a -m -t 202006040130.09 historic_conversions.csv
    ^ this command could be used to change the last modified date to test
